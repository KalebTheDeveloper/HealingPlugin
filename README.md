# HealingPlugin
Simple Plugin, used as a reference guide for applications

This is also one of my first plugins that I have created as well.
Version 1.0

The main purpose of this plugin is to simply just head a specified player.

I created this plugin as a \heal only based plugin so it is easy on the server and doesn't eat up the un-needed resources.
